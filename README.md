## About
MaileX is a innovative Application making a effort to build bridges between Generations and making emailing a bit more fun


It has been ages since the last time email have been revolutionized. The generation that is entering the work force is not very comfortable with using email. They believe, it is boring and frankly I do too.

The generation I am referring to likes to scroll, big social media companies have taken advantage of that and creating all social media's  with a key feature "endless scrolling".
And it is also phsycologically proven that scrolling model, have the least bounce rate.

Now imagine you wake up in the morning and check your email, but rather than clicking and open each of them. What is you had all you email in a scrollable feed with each email shown as a post.
